**很有可能**,无论你喜欢什么,它都有着强烈的味道和盐味,甜味或者是**咸味**.

**People generally like to eat tasty foods,and this can create potential health problems,especially with the consumption of fast or processed food.**

人们通常喜欢去吃好吃的食物,(类似转折)这可能产生潜在的健康问题,尤其是吃的(原意:消耗)快餐或者加工食品.

**Fast food traditionally contain a lot of salt or sugar,because this is a cheap way to make food taste good and it encourages people to buy more cookies,chips and soft drinks,for example.**

例如快餐通常会包含很多的盐和糖,因为这是一种非常便宜的方式使食物尝起来好吃并且快餐(店)会激励人们去买更多的饼干,薯条,和软饮.

**However,people are becoming increasingly aware of the dangers of an unhealthy diet,and the manufacturers of processed food know that sales will increase if they can advertise that their products have less salt or sugar.**

然而,人们正在越来越意识到不健康饮食的危险,并且食品生产商知道如果他们宣传他们的产品少盐少糖销售量将会增加.

**They also know that if their product tastes bland or boring,no amount of health benefits will make it a popular choice with consumers,and they will lose money if their product is not popular.**

他们也知道如果他们的产品乏味或无聊,(即使)产品有多健康消费者也不会选择,然后如果产品部流行他们将会损失?.

**However,a new technology is currently being developed that may allow fast food manufacturers to reduce salt and sugar without sacrificing taste.**

然而,一个现在正在发展的新技术会允许快餐制造商在不牺牲味道的情况下减少盐和糖.

### para.B

**If you stick out your tongue and look in the mirror, you will see that it is covered with tiny bumps.**

如果说你伸出舌头照镜子,你将会看到它上面充满了小的疙瘩.

**These bumps are called taste buds and they are the receptors in our skin that allow us to taste,**

**different kinds of foods.**

这些疙瘩称作buds并且他们是允许我们去尝出不同食物种类的受体.

**There are five different taste receptors, for sweet, salty, sour, bitter and savoury flavours.** 

有五种食物的受体,分别是甜,盐味,酸味苦味和咸味(的受体).

**When we are born we have a lot of these on the roof of our mouth as well as on our tongue, but as we get older, we lose taste buds, which is why older people find it harder to taste things.**

当我们出生的时候我们有很多这些(受体)在我们的我们的嘴顶部和舌头上,但是随着我们长大时候,我们失去了味觉buds,这就是为什么老年年人发现更难尝出东西的原因.

**Adults typically have about 10,000 taste buds, but older people may have as few as 5,000.**

成年人通常要大约10000个味觉buds,但是老年人可能只有少到5000个.

**We have more receptors for bitter tastes than for any others; researchers think that this may be because**
**these taste buds warn us if food is poisonous.**

我们相比于任何其他味觉受体有更多的苦味味觉受体,研究者认为这可能是因为如果食物有毒这些味觉buds会警告我们.



**补充: buds 可以翻译为*萌芽*不过有点怪**

**receptor 可以翻译为 *感觉器官* 不过这里应该不是属于器官**

### para.C

**The food that we eat contains natural chemicals that fit into the different shaped receptors on our tongues;**

我们吃的食物包含天然的化学物质,这些化学物质适合进入在我们舌头上不同形状的受体;

**for example, sweet foods ==trigger== the sweet receptors.**

举个栗子,甜的食物会激发甜味受体

**The technology to mimic, or copy, these natural flavours with chemicals such as ==aspartame(猜到了)== has been in existence for a long time, and aspartame is a common ingredient in many diet soft drinks and other diet products.**

用化学品科技去模仿,或者复制这些自然的味道比如说阿斯巴甜已经存在很长时间(了),并且阿斯巴甜也是在很多减肥软饮和其他减肥产品中的常见成分.

**While aspartame allows us to experience a sweet taste without eating sugar, it also has disadvantages. Firstly, many people do not like its bitter aftertaste, and secondly, some people say that it is bad for health if taken in large quantities.**

然而阿斯巴甜允许我们去体现甜味而没有吃糖也是有不利因素的.首先很多人不喜欢阿斯巴甜苦苦的回味,其次,很多人说如果摄入过多阿斯巴甜对健康有不好.

### para.D

 **However, a new technology is being developed that may be an improvement on artificial sweeteners and other chemicals.**

然而,一个可能是人造甜味剂和其他化学制品的改善的新的技术正在(被)开发.

**Taste enhancers target the taste receptors on our tongues, and they make us more sensitive to sweet, sour or salty tastes.**

味觉增强物以在我们舌头上的味觉受体当作目标,并且他们使我们更加的对于甜味,酸味或者盐味有感觉.

**Just a few molecules of a taste enhancer could double the sweetness effect of a teaspoon of sugar, or the salty effect of a teaspoon of salt.**

只要几**分子**的味觉增强物就能够让**一茶勺**糖或者**一茶勺**的盐的味道翻倍.

**This means that instead of using artificial chemicals to make food tasty, food manufacturers could use half the quantity of the real substance and a tiny quantity of taste enhancer to make the food taste good.**

这意味着食品制造商可以使用一半的真真的物质和少量的味觉增强物来使食品味道更好而不是使用人工化学制品让食物好吃.

**This has the potential to save food manufacturers money, by replacing large quantities of sugar and salt with tiny amounts of chemicals.**

这(项技术)有着潜力去通过少量的化学物品去替代大量的糖和盐(从而)节省食物生产商的?

**It could also benefit our health if we can eat food that tastes good and is low in sugar and salt.**

如果我们能吃到味道好并且糖和盐含量低的食物,这也会有益于我们的健康.

### para.E

**Taste enhancers have other advantages, too.**

味觉增强物也有其他的好处.

**People generally do not like bitter tasting food, but ==reversing== this technology so that the bitter taste receptors are blocked instead of stimulated may reduce the bitter taste of some healthy foods.**

人们通常不喜欢尝起来苦的食物,但是**扭转**这个技术就可以把苦味受体阻断代替刺激一些健康的食物尝起来的苦味

**This means, for example, that people may be persuaded to eat more soy protein.**

这意味着,举个例子,人们可以被劝说的吃更多的大豆蛋白.

### para .F

**Taste enhancer technology is very new to the marketplace, and ==as yet== it is not widely used, but it has the potential to make a significant change to the processed food industry, and to improve the healthiness of many fast foods.**

味觉增强剂技术在市场上是非常新的,并且到**目前为止**没有广泛的使用,但是(这个技术)有潜力在加工食品行业去做一个重要(重大)的改变,并且去改善很多快餐的健康情况.
