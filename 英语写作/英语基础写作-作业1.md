#### Title: Some people think everyone should be a vegetarian, because they do not need to eat meat to stay healthy. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

No,I disagree, people need to eat meet to keep them healthy. Helthy can make people learn or work more efficiently, and live more powerful, thus we need to eat meet.

#### Title: In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

I don't agree. I don't think online books or articals will be free.The books income will stimulate authors to create. Without income, authors and presses will not have the motivation to write, so I think we need pay for it before reading some of the articles in the future.
However despite the ebooks need money, I still agree no one will buy printed newspapers or books.Fist of all, the online articles are more convenient than self-made articles, you don't need to go to bookshops or library. Just click the mouse or touch the screen then you can read.And second, both books and ebooks are the container of words.And there is no doubt that internet books or newspapers will replace papers.There are many books now are written in the paper, but I think   the press of them will digitize them in the future, because this will reduce the cost of books, like transportation costs, binding costs, storage costs.


#### Title: Some people think that arts (such as painting and music) do not directly improve people’s life, so government should spend money on other areas. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
